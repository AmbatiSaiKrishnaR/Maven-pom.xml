    Test that the mirror wildcard * matches any repo.

  <!--
  Each module has a single repo definition which points into nowhere. If the mirror wouldn't match it, a module
  won't be able to resolve its dependencies (which are unique to each module, i.e. can't be satisfied from downloads
  by the other modules).
