Maven Core Integration Tests

  This module provides the {{{./testapidocs/org/apache/maven/it/package-summary.html}effective Integration Tests suite}}.

* Running the ITs

  By default, the project just packages the tests in an artifact. To actually run them, activate the <<<run-its>>> profile:
  
+----
mvn clean test -Prun-its
+----
  
  This will subject the Maven version running the build to the integration tests.
  
  If you would like to test a different Maven distribution, you can use the <<<mavenHome>>> system property to specify the
  path of the Maven distribution to test:
  
+----
mvn clean test -Prun-its -DmavenHome=<maven-under-test>
+----
  
  Alternatively, you can just specify the version of a previously installed/deployed Maven distribution which will be
  downloaded, unpacked and tested:
  
+----
mvn clean test -Prun-its -DmavenVersion=2.2.1
+----
  
  To run the ITs using embedded Maven 3.x, additionally activate the <<<embedded>>> profile.
  
  ITs that don't require to fork Maven can also be run from the IDE using the Maven projects from the workspace if the
  Maven dependencies are added to the test class path.
  
  If you're behind a proxy, use the <<<proxy.host>>>, <<<proxy.port>>>, <<<proxy.user>>> and <<<proxy.pass>>> system properties
  to specify the required proxy setup for the ITs. Alternatively, set the <<<maven.it.central>>> system property to a URL of a local
  repository manager that proxies the required artifacts.

* Results

  ITs results are displayed on the console and can be published in the site through Surefire Report.
