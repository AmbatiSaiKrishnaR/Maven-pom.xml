What ITs use what versions of the maven-core-it-support

it0002: 1.0
it0021: 1.0
it0034: 1.4 (but uses a range to make sure the latest is nabbed)
it0035: 1.1 and 1.1-old-location
it0041: 1.2
it0084: 1.3, 1.4 though no check is made for them in the IT
it0092: 1.0-SNAPSHOT and we don't have this anywhere in source form, nice.
