What ITs use what versions of the maven-core-it-support

it0002: 1.0
it0021: 1.0
it0034: 1.4 (but uses a range to make sure the latest is nabbed)
it0035: 1.1 and 1.1-old-location
it0041: 1.2
it0084: 1.3, 1.4 though no check is made for them in the IT
        This uses commons-io, but create another artifact to use in this
        test so that we don't have to depend on anything extneral.

        1.3 also uses junit for some exclusion testing, again make something
        ourselves for the test.

it0092: 1.0-SNAPSHOT and we don't have this anywhere in source form, nice.
